Welcome to the user guide for the bug analysis website for SQLancer. <br>

This website is designed to **compile bugs found by SQLancer** reported in different sources and **aggregating the data collected into graphs and tables** to derive useful information. <br>

If you are a database designer or database tester this website can help you to keep track and take note of currently open bug reports as well as bugs that have already been fixed! <br>

If you are a database user this website can help you to find interesting trends such as which database management system has had the least bugs in recent months or fix bug reports the quickest! <br>

Refer to the `Quick Start` section to get the website running and the `Features` section on the features that are available. <br>
