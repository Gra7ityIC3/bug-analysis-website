# Bug Analysis Website User Guide

This website is designed to **compile bugs found by SQLancer** reported across multiple sources such as GitHub issues and **visualize the aggregated data in charts and tables** to gain useful insights.

If you are a **database system developer** or **tester**, you can use this website to track which bugs have been found or fixed and identify common bugs to better prioritize debugging or testing efforts.

If you are a **database user**, you can explore trends in bug frequency, rate of bug fixes, and overall reliability across different database systems.

Refer to the [Quick Start](#quick-start) section to get started and the [Features](#features) section to explore what the website can do.

## Quick Start

1. Ensure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download) version 18 or later installed.
2. Download and unzip the source code archive file from [here](https://github.com/NUS-CS3213-AY2425S2/bug-analysis-project-group-13/releases/latest).
3. Download the `.env` file from [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1h-SdR_qSfQC5Fzs8qkBQ3JCDehea29-l/view?usp=sharing) and save it in the `backend/` directory.

   > When downloading the `.env` file, make sure the filename includes the leading `.`

4. Open two command terminals and `cd` to the project directory.

   On the first terminal, run the following commands:

   ```
   cd frontend
   npm install
   npm run dev
   ```

   On the second terminal, run the following commands:

   ```
   cd backend
   npm install
   node server.js
   ```
5. The website can be accessed at http://localhost:5173/.

## Features

### Viewing bug reports

You can view bug reports on two separate pages: **GitHub Issues** and **SQLancer Bug Reports**.

Each page displays a table of bug reports sorted by **Date Posted** in descending order. By default, bug reports labeled as "Not a bug" are hidden from the table.

![GitHub Issues](images/GitHubIssues.png)

1. **Pagination**: Use the buttons on the bottom toolbar to navigate between pages. Use the dropdown menu to adjust the number of rows displayed per page.
2. **Detail panel**: Click the expand button on a row to view its description. Click the expand all button on the column header to expand or collapse all rows at once.
3. **View issue on GitHub**: Click the open in new icon on a row to view the original issue on GitHub in a new tab.

The **SQLancer Bug Reports** page shares the same layout but excludes links to the original source. The bug reports are retrieved from the official [SQLancer bugs repository](https://github.com/sqlancer/bugs/blob/master/bugs.json).

### Searching and filtering bug reports

You can search for bug reports containing specific keywords using the **search box** in the top toolbar. This performs a global search across all columns containing text, such as the title and test oracle. Note that the bug report description in the detail panel is not included in the search.

![Search Bug Reports](images/SearchBugReports.png)

You can also filter bug reports by specific columns using the column filters in the column headers.

![Filter Bug Reports](images/FilterBugReports.png)

Alternatively, you can click the **column actions button** on a column header to filter by that column.

![Filter Bug Reports Using Column Menu](images/FilterBugReportsUsingColumnMenu.png)

> [!NOTE]
> You may need to scroll horizontally to see all column filters.

### Sorting and grouping bug reports

You can sort bug reports by clicking the **column headers** or by clicking the **column actions button** and selecting a sort option.

![Sort Bug Reports](images/SortBugReports.png)

> [!TIP]
> You can sort bug reports by multiple columns by holding down the `shift` key while clicking the column headers.

You can also group bug reports using the **drag handle button** to drag columns into the top toolbar or by clicking the **column actions button** and selecting "Group by [Column]".

![Group Bug Reports](images/GroupBugReports.png)

![Group Bug Reports by DBMS](images/GroupBugReportsByDBMS.png)

> [!TIP]
> You can group bug reports by multiple columns by dragging them into the toolbar. The order of the columns determines the grouping order.

### Editing bug reports

You can edit the **DBMS**, **Test Oracle**, and **Status** fields of a GitHub issue by clicking the **edit icon** in the Actions column of the corresponding row. This makes the entire row editable, allowing you to make changes and save them in place.

For **SQLancer bug reports**, only the **Status** and **Severity** fields are editable.

### Deleting bug reports

You can delete a bug report by clicking the **delete icon** in the Actions column of the corresponding row. This opens a confirmation dialog asking you to confirm the deletion.

![Delete Bug Report](images/DeleteBugReport.png)

![Delete Bug Report Confirmation Dialog](images/DeleteBugReportConfirmationDialog.png)

You can also delete multiple bug reports at once by selecting the rows you want to delete using the checkboxes and clicking the **delete icon** in the top toolbar. Similarly, this opens a confirmation dialog asking you to confirm the deletion.

![Delete Bug Reports](images/DeleteBugReports.png)

![Delete Bug Reports Confirmation Dialog](images/DeleteBugReportsConfirmationDialog.png)

> [!CAUTION]
> Deleting bug reports is permanent and cannot be undone. Make sure you intend to delete them before confirming.

### Refreshing GitHub issues

You can update the list of GitHub issues by clicking the **refresh icon** in the top toolbar. New issues will be added to the top of the table, while existing issues will be updated in place.

![Refresh GitHub Issues](images/RefreshGitHubIssues.png)

### Generating charts for selected GitHub issues

You can generate summary charts for selected GitHub issues by selecting the rows you want using the checkboxes and clicking the **chart icon** in the top toolbar. This opens a chart dialog that shows different charts based on the selected field.

![Generate Charts for Selected GitHub Issues](images/GenerateChartsForSelectedGitHubIssues.png)

![Chart Dialog for DBMS](images/ChartDialogForDBMS.png)

![Chart Dialog for Date Posted](images/ChartDialogForDatePosted.png)

The chart dialog allows you to:

1. **Choose a field** to group the issues by:
   - DBMS
   - Oracle
   - Status
   - Date Posted
2. **Specify a start date and end date** to filter issues grouped by **Date Posted**.
3. **Select up to 5 DBMSs** to display in the chart when grouping issues by **Date Posted**.

> [!NOTE]
> Issues where the DBMS is "N/A" and Status is "Not a bug" are excluded from the charts.

### Viewing summary statistics

The **Summary Statistics** page provides an overview of bug reports by status for each DBMS across GitHub issues and SQLancer bug reports.

You can switch between three view modes to view the statistics: **table**, **bar chart**, and **line chart**.

![Table View](images/TableView.png)

![Bar Chart View](images/BarChartView.png)

![Line Chart View](images/LineChartView.png)

The line chart shows the number of bug reports for each DBMS per month and allows you to:

- Filter by a date range
- Select specific DBMSs using the chips above the chart

### Viewing supported DBMSs

The **Suppported DBMSs** page shows all database management systems currently supported by SQLancer.

## FAQ

**Q**: Why is there no refresh feature for SQLancer bug reports?<br>
**A**: SQLancer bug reports are compiled manually in the official [SQLancer bugs repository](https://github.com/sqlancer/bugs/blob/master/bugs.json), which is not frequently updated. As such, there is no refresh feature for SQLancer bug reports in the current version of the website.

**Q**: Why canâ€™t I generate charts for SQLancer bug reports?<br>
**A**: Chart generation is only supported for GitHub issues because they are regularly updated and reflect the latest data, whereas SQLancer bug reports are compiled manually and not updated frequently.
