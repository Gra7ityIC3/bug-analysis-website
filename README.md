# Bug Analysis Website Group 13

This website is designed to compile bugs found by SQLancer reported across multiple sources (e.g., GitHub issues) and visualize the aggregated data in charts and tables to gain useful insights.

If you are a database system developer or tester, you can use this website to track which bugs have been found or fixed and identify common bugs to better prioritize debugging or testing efforts.

If you are a database user, you can explore trends in bug frequency, fix rates, and overall reliability across different database systems.

Refer to the user guide of the latest release [here](https://github.com/NUS-CS3213-AY2425S2/bug-analysis-project-group-13/releases/latest) for more information such as how to get started and explore the features of the website.
