# Bug Analysis Website Group 13

This website is designed to **compile bugs found by SQLancer** reported across multiple sources such as GitHub issues and **visualize the aggregated data in charts and tables** to gain useful insights.

If you are a **database system developer** or **tester**, you can use this website to track which bugs have been found or fixed and identify common bugs to better prioritize debugging or testing efforts.

If you are a **database user**, you can explore trends in bug frequency, rate of bug fixes, and overall reliability across different database systems.

Refer to the [user guide](docs/Documentation.md) for more information on getting started and exploring the features of the website.
